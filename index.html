He has my heart until the end of time; always and forever.""

				<p> 
					I remember the first time I saw you. I couldn't keep my eyes off you and keep my mouth closed. I knew from the moment I saw you I was going to spend the rest of my life with you. I'm so lucky to find my other half in you and the same to me. I can't wait to grow old and have kids and grand kids with you; and when the time comes for us to leace this place I will always know that I spent all my days with my best friend and my true love. Love you always, Time.
